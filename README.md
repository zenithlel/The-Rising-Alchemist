I aim for this repository to become a resource for all fellow alchemists who want to start with covalent to have a really good start

I think of covalent like the cauldron of an alchemist, you insert ingredients ( your input requirements) and it gives the product in response.

Simply put, covalent pulls whatever data you want in whatever shape you want. You just need to give it instructions

After finishing this tutorial, and another assigment I really had a very good idea of how covalent works.


Wait for my future updates.


Second:

<h2> A list of questions to have a basic understanding of how to use the data provided by covalent!</h2>

Forgive the poor graphics, I'm a junior backend dev who has no idea how design works

Since the alchemist usually visualized in green color, I choose the green and white ! The most popular colors for Alchemists!

I will continue to add more questions even after submission
